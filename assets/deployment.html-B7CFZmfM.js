Our &quot;component mapping&quot; approach means that no runtime logic is modified inside Unity - if you want you can regularily use Play Mode and build to other target platforms. In some cases this will mean that you have duplicate code (C# code and matching TypeScript logic). The amount of extra work through this depends on your project.</p><p><strong>Enter Play Mode in Unity</strong><br> In <code>Project Settings &gt; Needle Engine</code>, you can turn off <code>Override Play Mode</code> and <code>Override Build settings</code> to switch between Needle&#39;s build process and Unity&#39;s build process:<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2693840/187308490-5acb9016-ffff-4113-be62-4de450a42b08.png" alt="image"></p><h2 id="needle-engine-commandline-arguments-for-unity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#needle-engine-commandline-arguments-for-unity"><span>Needle Engine Commandline Arguments for Unity</span></a></h2><p>Needle Engine for Unity supports various commandline arguments to export single assets (Prefabs or Scenes) or to build a whole web project in batch mode (windowsless).</p><p>The following list gives a table over the available options:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>-scene</code></td><td>path to a scene or a asset to be exported e.g. <code>Assets/path/to/myObject.prefab</code> or <code>Assets/path/to/myScene.unity</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>-outputPath &lt;path/to/output.glb&gt;</code></td><td>set the output path for the build (only valid when building a scene)</td></tr><tr><td><code>-buildProduction</code></td><td>run a production build</td></tr><tr><td><code>-buildDevelopment</code></td><td>run a development build</td></tr><tr><td><code>-debug</code></td><td>open a console window for debugging</td></tr></tbody></table>',21))])}const R=C(O,[["render",E]]),V=JSON.parse('{"path":"/deployment.html","title":"Deployment and Optimization","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Deployment and Optimization","head":[["meta",{"name":"og:image","content":"https://engine.needle.tools/docs/.preview/deployment and optimization.png"}],["meta",{"name":"og:description","content":"---\\nDeployment is the process of making your application available to the public on a website.
