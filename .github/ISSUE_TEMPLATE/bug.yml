      description: Please provide a link for download or a link to a repo that can reproduce the problem you ran into. A [minimal reproduction](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is favored ([Why?](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required)). If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "need reproduction" label. For quickly collecting the scene files needed for a report you can use the menu item under ``Needle Engine/Bug Report/Zip Scene`` in Unity. You can also create a project on StackBlitz using https://engine.needle.tools/new. Thank you!
