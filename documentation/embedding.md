# Needle Engine on your Website

Needle Engine can be used to create new web apps, and can also be integrated int
o existing websites. In both cases, you'll want to _upload_ your project's distr
ibution folder to a web hoster to make them accessible to the world.

There are several ways to integrate Needle Engine with your website. Which one i
s better depends on a number of factors, like complexity of your project, if you
're using custom scripts or only core components, how much control you have over
 the target website, what the "trust level" is between you and the target websit
e, and so on.

## Try it out

If you want to quickly try out how projects made with Needle will look on your w
ebsite, just add these two lines anywhere on your page for testing:

# Ways to create web apps with Needle

The most common workflows to bring Needle Engine to your website are:
1. [Using the "Deploy to ..." components](#using-the-deploy-to-...-components)
2. [Uploading your web app to a folder](#uploading-your-web-app-to-a-folder)
3. [Embedding a Needle project into an existing website](#embedding-a-needle-pro
ject-into-an-existing-website)

## Using the "Deploy to ..." components

Our Needle Engine integrations ship with built-in deployment options. You can de
ploy your project to Needle Cloud, FTP servers, Glitch, Itch.io, GitHub Pages, a
nd more with just a few clicks.

See the [Deployment](./deployment.md) section for more information on each of th
ese options.

1. Add the "Deploy to ..." component you want to use to your scene in Unity or B
lender.
2. Configure the necessary options and click on "Deploy".
3. That's it! Your project is now live.

:::tip Recommended Workflow
This is the easiest option, and recommended for most workflows â€“ it's very fast!
 You can iteratively work on your project on your computer, and then upload a ne
w version to the web in seconds.
:::

## Uploading your web app to a folder

If you don't want to use our "Deploy to..." components, or there's no component
for your particlar workflow, you can do the same process manually. The resulting
 web app will be identical to what you see in your local server while working on
 the project.

1. Make a production build of your web project. This will create a `dist/` folde
r with all necessary files, ready for distribution. It contains all necessary fi
les, including the JavaScript bundle, the HTML file, and any other assets like t
extures, audio, or video files.

2. Upload the content of the `dist/` folder from your Web Project to your web ho
ster. You can do this via FTP, SFTP, or any other file transfer method your host
er provides. Look at the documentation of your web hoster for details.

3. That's it! Your web app is now live.


::: tip The folder location influences the URL of your web app.
Depending on your hoster's settings, the folder location and name determine what
 the URL of your web app is. Here's an example:
- Your domain `https://your-website.com/` points at the folder `/var/www/html` o
n your webspace.
- You upload your files to `/var/www/html/my-app` so that the `index.html` file
is at `/var/www/html/my-app/index.html`.
- The URL of your web app is now `https://your-website.com/my-app/`.
:::

## Embedding a Needle project into an existing website

In some cases, you want a Needle Engine project to be part of an existing web si
te, for example as a part of a blog post, a product page, or a portfolio. The pr
ocess is very similar, but instead of uploading the files to the root of your we
b space, you _embed_ the project into an existing website with a few lines of co
de.

1. Make a production build of your web project. This will create a `dist/` folde
r with all necessary files, ready for distribution. It contains all necessary fi
les, including the JavaScript bundle, the HTML file, and any other assets like t
extures, audio, or video files.

2. Upload the `dist/` folder from your Web Project to your web hoster.
    ::: tip The folder can be hosted anywhere!
    If you don't have access to your web hoster's file system, or no way to uplo
ad files there, you can upload the folder to any other webspace and  use the pub
lic URL of that in the next step.
    :::

3. Inside your `dist` folder, you'll find an `index.html` file. We want to copy
some lines from this folder, so open the file in a text editor. Typically, it lo
oks like this:
    ```html
    <head>
        ...
        <script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-732f0764.js"></scr
ipt>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <needle-engine src="assets/scene.glb"></needle-engine>
    </body>
    ```

    There are two important lines here:
    - the JavaScript bundle inside `<script>`,
    - the `<needle-engine>` HTML tag.

4. On the target website, add the `<script...>` and `<needle-engine...>` tags as
 well. Make sure that the paths point at the location where you have uploaded th
e files to.
    ```html
    <script type="module" src="/your-upload-folder/assets/index-732f0764.js"></s
cript>
    <needle-engine src="/your-upload-folder/assets/scene.glb"></needle-engine>
    ```

5. That's it! The scene should now be displayed on your website.

## Embedding a Needle project as iframe

When you have limited access to a website, for example when you're using a CMS l
ike WordPress, you can use an iframe to embed a Needle Engine scene into your we
bsite. You may know this workflow from embedding YouTube videos or Sketchfab mod
els.

1. Make a production build of your web project. This will create a `dist/` folde
r with all necessary files, ready for distribution.

2. Upload the `dist/` folder from your Web Project to your web hoster.
    ::: tip The folder can be hosted anywhere!
    If you don't have access to your web hoster's file system, or no way to uplo
ad files there, you can upload the folder to any other webspace and  use the pub
lic URL of that in the next step.
    :::

3. Add an iframe to your website, pointing to the `index.html` file in the `dist
/` folder.
    ```html
    <iframe
        src="https://your-website.com/needle-files/dist/index.html"
        allow="xr; xr-spatial-tracking; fullscreen;">
    </iframe>
    ```


    ::: tip Permissions inside iframes
    The list inside `allow=` depends on the features your web app uses. For exam
ple, XR applications require `xr` and `xr-spatial-tracking` to work inside ifram
es.

    There may be additional features needed, for example `camera; microphone; xr
-spatial-tracking; accelerometer; gyroscope; display-capture; geolocation;`. See
 [the full list of iframe Permissions Policy directives on MDN](https://develope
r.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy#directives).
    :::

4. That's it! The scene should now be displayed on your website.

## Embedding scenes that use no custom scripts

When your project uses only core components and no custom scripts, you can direc
tly use Needle Engine from a CDN (content-delivery network).

1. Add the following snippet to your website, for example as "HTML Block" in you
r CMS:
    ```html
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@needle-tools/engine
/dist/needle-engine.min.js"></script>
    <needle-engine src="https://cloud.needle.tools/api/v1/public/873a48a/10801b1
11/MusicalInstrument.glb" background-blurriness="0.8"></needle-engine>
    ```
2. Upload the `assets/` folder from your Web Project to your web hoster. Dependi
ng on your project settings, this folder contains one or more `.glb` files and a
ny number of other files like audio, video, skybox and more.

3. Change the `src=` attribute of the `needle-engine` tag to the URL of the `.gl
b` file you want to display. Typically, this will be some path like `https://you
r-website.com/assets/MyScene.glb`.

4. That's it! The scene should now be displayed on your website.

## Embedding a Needle Cloud web app as iframe

If you deployed your project to Needle Cloud, you can easily display it on your
own website with an iframe.

# Common Workflows

## Creating a web app for a client's website

1. **Understand what type of app you're building**, and if and how it connects t
o an existing website.
   Often, you're building a standalone app that is accessible from a link on the
 client's domain.
   But there might also be other server-side and client-side components involved
.

2. **Understand which URL the web app should be accessible from.**
  This could either be

    - A page on **[Needle Cloud](./cloud/)**
      `collaborativesandbox-zubcks1qdkhy.needle.run`

    - A **Subpage** on the client's website
      `my-page.com/app`

    - A new **Subdomain**
      `app.my-page.com`
    - A new or existing **Domain**
      `my-app.com`

    ::: tip There's no "good" or "bad" here.
    A typical approach is to start on [Needle Cloud](./cloud/) for initial proto
types and during development, and move to the client's webspace and domain for t
he final version.

    The choice mostly depends on the client's requirements regarding branding, S
EO, and technical setup. Often, you'll have to discuss this with the client's IT
 department or webmaster.
    :::

1. **Understand how the web app will be deployed and maintained.**
    - Will you have access to a folder on the client's web server so you can upl
oad the latest version, or do they want to manage the deployment themselves?
      ::: tip A simple approach: FTP access
      Often, you can ask for FTP or SFTP access to a folder on the client's web
server. You'll get a URL, username, and password, and then you can upload your f
iles to that folder. We provide a "Deploy to FTP" component that makes this part
icularly easy. The client's IT department will set up which URL the folder is ac
cessible from.
        :::

    - Is there a lot of content that needs to be updated regularly, or is the ap
p mostly static?
        ::: tip Static vs. dynamic content
        For mostly static content, it's often enough to upload a new build from
time to time. For dynamic content, you might need a CMS (content management syst
em) or a database connection.
        :::
    - Which devices and browsers are the target audience using?
        ::: tip Browser compatibility and testing
        While Needle Engine works on all modern devices and browsers, it's alway
s a good idea to test your app on the devices and browsers your target audience
is using to make sure everything works as expected. For example, when creating a
n AR app for phones, you'll want to test across Android and iOS devices.
        :::

2. **Set up the project, a test deployment, and client deployment.**
   It's often a good idea to test the deployment process early on, to make sure
you understand how it works and what the requirements are. For example, when you
've decided on using FTP, then you could set up a test folder on your own web se
rver and test the deployment process there. Once changes are approved by the cli
ent, you can then deploy to the client's server.

3. **Start creating!**
   With requirements and deployment in place, go ahead and start making your pro
ject! You'll usually iterate locally, then deploy to your test server for approv
al, and then to the client's server.

## Wordpress

1. Decide on the method you want to use to embed your Needle Engine project. You
 can either use the "Embedding a Needle project into an existing website" method
, or the "Embedding a Needle project as iframe" method.

2. Upload the content of the `dist/` folder from your Web Project to your web ho
ster. Usually, the Wordpress uploads directory is located at `wp-content/uploads
/`.

    ::: tip Wordpress Backups
    You can decide if your new project should be at `wp-content/uploads/my-proje
ct/`, or at a different location like `my-projects/my-project`. This affects if
and how your project will be contained in Wordpress backups.
    :::

3. In the page you want to add Needle Engine to, add a `HTML` block and paste th
e code snippet as outlined above â€“ either as script embed, or as iframe.

## Shopify

::: warning <b>Under construction.</b> Needs to be documented.
:::

## Wix

To embed your Needle Engine project into a Wix website, you'll first deploy it to Needle Cloud and then use an HTML iframe on your Wix page.

1.  **Deploy to Needle Cloud**:
    *   In your Needle Engine project (e.g., in Unity), right-click your `*.needle` scene asset and select `Build for Publishing`.
    *   This will build your project and automatically upload it to Needle Cloud.
    *   Once the upload is complete, your browser will open with the Needle Cloud URL for your project. Copy this URL. You can also find all your deployments at [https://needle.tools/cloud](https://needle.tools/cloud).

2.  **Get your public project URL**:
    *   From Needle Cloud, ensure you have the public URL for your deployed project (e.g., `https://your-project-name.needle.run`).

3.  **Add HTML iframe in Wix Editor**:
    *   Open your Wix site in the Wix Editor.
    *   Click `+ Add` on the left side of the Editor.
    *   Go to `Embed Code` and then select `Embed HTML`. An HTML iframe element will be added to your page.

4.  **Set the iframe source**:
    *   Select the newly added HTML element on your page.
    *   Click `Enter Code`.
    *   In the `What do you want to add?` section, choose `Code`.
    *   In the HTML code box, paste the following, replacing `YOUR_NEEDLE_CLOUD_URL` with the URL you copied in step 2:
        ```html
        <iframe src="YOUR_NEEDLE_CLOUD_URL" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen="" allow="xr-spatial-tracking; fullscreen; camera; microphone"></iframe>
        ```
    *   Click `Update`.

5.  **Adjust iframe size and permissions**:
    *   Resize the iframe element on your Wix page to your desired dimensions.
    *   The `allow` attribute in the iframe code snippet above includes common permissions for interactive and XR experiences (`xr-spatial-tracking`, `fullscreen`, `camera`, `microphone`). Adjust these as necessary for your project's requirements. For basic 3D viewers without XR, you might only need `allow="fullscreen"`. For XR projects, ensure `xr-spatial-tracking` (and potentially `camera` for AR) is included.
    *   Wix may have its own settings for iframe permissions or sandboxing that you might need to check if you encounter issues.

That's it! Your Needle Engine project should now be embedded in your Wix site.
