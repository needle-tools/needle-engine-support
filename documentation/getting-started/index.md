## Required Tools

:::tip Automatic Installation with Unity or Blender
When using the Unity or Blender integration, we'll guide you through installing these tools automatically. You don't need to install them manually.
:::

The following tools are used by Needle Engine to create, preview, and build your web app:

<ClientOnly>

### Node.js (Required)

<os-link windows_url="https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/nodejs/win" osx_url="https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/nodejs/osx">Download Node.js 20 LTS or 22 LTS</os-link>

**What it does:**
- Manages your web project dependencies
- Runs a local development server with hot reload
- Builds and optimizes your project for production
- Handles deployment to hosting platforms

### KTX Software (Recommended)

<os-link windows_url="https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/toktx/win" osx_url="https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/toktx/osx" osx_silicon_url="https://fwd.needle.tools/needle-engine/toktx/osx-silicon">Download toktx texture tools</os-link>

**What it does:**
- Compresses textures for optimal web performance
- Reduces file sizes dramatically without quality loss
- Creates GPU-compressed formats (KTX2)
- Required for production builds
