With **Needle Engine**, you can create fully interactive 3D websites using your favorite framework.

Projects created with Needle Engine can be deployed anywhere on the web and get optimized automatically by our state of the art optimization pipeline with automatic LOD support – reducing asset size by up x100 without compromising quality.   

Needle Engine is available as a **package for Unity, add-on for Blender, a ready-to-go Web Component**, or as a npm package for projects without an editor integration.    
Each of these comes with the same components our building blocks and to power to create more – the choice is yours.

## Code Editor and Tools

### Install a code editor

Needle Engine makes it easy to build web apps. That often, but not always, includes coding with JavaScript/TypeScript or writing HTML and CSS to describe user interfacces. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for creating and editing these files. It's a free, open-source code editor that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Other useful tools

::: tip
Needle Engine uses the following tools to create your web app, but you don't need to manually install them when using the Unity or Blender integration. We'll guide you through the installation process after you've installed the Needle integration.

Needle Engine uses Node.js to manage, preview and build the web app that you are creating locally on your computer.     
It is also used for uploading (deploying) your website to the internet.

## Option 1: Quick Start — Starter Project ⚡
1. **Download or Clone this repository**  
   It's set up with the right packages and settings to get you started right away.  

   _Clone with HTTPS:_ ``https://github.com/needle-tools/needle-engine-support.git``  
   _OR clone with SSH:_ ``git@github.com:needle-tools/needle-engine-support.git``  
   _OR download directly:_ <a href="https://github.com/needle-tools/needle-engine-support/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">Download Repository</a>
   
  
2. **Open the starter project**  
  Open `starter/Needle Engine Starter 2020_3` for a full sandbox project that's ready to run (including a couple of simple example scenes for lightmaps and custom shaders).  
  This is a sandbox builder project! It already comes with multi-player capabilities, and works across mobile, desktop, VR and AR.  

3. **Press Play**  
  Make sure the scene CollaborativeSandbox is open, and press Play! This will automatically do some setup steps and start a local server.  
  Once the setup is complete, a browser window will open, and your project is live.  
  From now on, all changes you do in Unity will be immediately visible in your browser.  

    > **Note**: Your browser might warn you about an untrusted SSL connection. Don't worry, the connection is still encrypted – please click "Advance" if your browser asks you to verify that you're sure you want to visit your server.  

4. **Make it your own**  
  Add assets and components, play around with lighting, add scripts and logic – this is your world now!
